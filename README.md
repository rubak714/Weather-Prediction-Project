# Predict Weather in Szeged using LR, PR, DT, RF, CV

Predict Weather in Szeged using Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest with Cross Validation, then apply Grid Search CV, and Random Search CV and find the best parameters and estimators. Finally, acheive 99.99% accuracy.

We want to explore the correlation between different weather parameters. We will also check if there is any relationship between humidity and temperature as well as humidity and apparent temperature and try to predict apparent temperature using the most important features. Finally we will calculate the accuracy of our model.
